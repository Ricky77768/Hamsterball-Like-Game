# Hamsterball Like Game
### Status: Work in Progress

A 3D ball-rolling game inspired by <a href="https://www.hamsterball.io/">Hamsterball</a>, one of the first video games I played. Developing using the C# and the Unity engine.

## About
The goal of the game is to reach the end of the level as fast as possible while navigating through the various obstables and bonuses scattered throughout each level. Each of the planned level will have a specific theme to them, and later levels require reaching a certain amount of time to unlock. 

## Gameplay Demonstration

## Features

* 10 planned levels with unique themes
* Customizable settings synced across multiple scenes and sessions

## Controls
* <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> To move, you can also use the mouse along with keyboard inputs.

* Falling too far can make the ball dizzy (slows you down for a while), and falling further will break the ball, forcing you to restart from the last checkpoint. Also, don't fall off!
